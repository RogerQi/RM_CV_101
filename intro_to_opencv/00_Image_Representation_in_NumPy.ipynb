    "Welcome to RMCV 101 week 2 - Intro to OpenCV. In this submodule, we will talk about basics of computer vision. We will start by introducing representation of images in computer. More specifically, how images are usually handled in Python. Then we will cover basic image operations such as binirization, gaussian blur, and morphological operations. Finally, you will learn about some classic CV algorithms such as\n",

It's a common practice for handling colors in the computer. For some historical reason, RGB values range from 0-255 (which takes exactly 1 byte in the memory).\n",

Therefore 'wider' color space is being introduced into the industry. The P-3 color space used in Apple's new high-end products is a good example.\n",
